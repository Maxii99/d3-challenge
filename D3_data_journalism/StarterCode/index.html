          <h4>Relationship between overty and lack of healthcare</h4>
          <p>Research has shown that wealthy people tend to be healthier because of access to healthcare.
            According to a study by the University of Wisconsin-Madison 
            (https://www.irp.wisc.edu/publications/factsheets/pdfs/PoorInPoorHealth.pdf)
             about 18.5% of the U.S. non-elderly population does not have health insurance, 
             and nearly 70% of the uninsured population is poor or near-poor. The above scatter plots seem to affirm this relationship
             However, it must be noted that not all unisured people are poor or are from low-income earners.  For instance, 
             Texas has the highest percentage of uninsured families, but Mississippi  and New Mexico have higher poverty rates.
            This suggests that other factors may be taken to account in explaining the relationship between poerty and lack of healthcare. </p>

          <h4>Relationship between poverty and smoking</h4>
          <p>According to the scatter plot, it appears that people who live below the poverty level have higher rates of smoking 
            than people in other income group. This relationship is supported by the CDC analysis that "finds that People living in poverty smoke cigarettes for a 
            duration of nearly twice as many years as people with a family income of three times the poverty rate." 
            (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/disparities/low-ses/index.htm).

          <h4>Relationship between poverty and obesity</h4>
          <p>In general, high-income countries have greater rates of obesity than middle- and low-income countries 
            (James WP. The epidemiology of obesity: the size of the problem. J Intern Med 2008;263:336–352). 
            As arguably the wealthiest countries in the world, the US has high obesity rates. According to the National
            Health Institute, one-third of the population has obesity plus another third is overweight 
            (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3198075/#B1).  The scatter plot analysis seems to confirm the NIH findings. 
            It's suggested that poor commuinities and families lack access to fresh unprocessed food as well as lack access to healthcare and therefore are 
            to see a doctor until their health situtaions worsen. However, states like Maryland and New Hampshire have low poverty rates but high obesity rates,
            indicating that other factors must be in play.

          <h4>Relationship between age and smoking</h4>
          <p>Acording to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) current cigarette smoking was highest among 
            people aged 25–44 years (16.5%) and 45–64 years (16.3%), and lowest among people aged 18-24 years (7.8%)
            (https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/adult_data/cig_smoking/index.htm). 
            The scatter plot above appears to confirm the CDC's finding.  States with high median age have 
            high number of adult smokers and vice versa.  For example, Vest Virgia has high media age and a high 
            percentage of adult smokers whereas Utah has a low median age and a very low percentage of smokers.
